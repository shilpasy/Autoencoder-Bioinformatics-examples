# Autoencoder-Bioinformatics-examples
Collection of examples and applications demonstrating the use of autoencoders in bioinformatics

# autoencoder_for_digits 
A simple example to start with!
This code demonstrates the basic structure and training of an autoencoder using synthetic data and visualizes the reconstruction process. 
The key takeaway is the ability of autoencoders to capture and represent the essential features of the input data in a compressed form.

# MultiModal_Omics_Autoencoder
Data integration of single-cell RNAseq and proteomics data is demonstrated.
